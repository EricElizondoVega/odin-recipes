            <li>Line a sheet pan or large plate with paper towels. 
                Stack 8 corn tortillas and cut them into quarters.</li>
            <li>n a large skillet set over medium heat, warm the cooking 
                oil until shimmering. Add two layers of tortilla quarters 
                at a time and fry, turning as needed, until lightly browned 
                and slightly crunchy, about 1 minute on each side. 
                Transfer the tortilla quarters to the paper towel-lined plate to drain. 
                Repeat with the remaining tortilla quarters.</li>
            <li>Warm the red enchilada sauce* in a large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Divide tortilla chips between two large plates. 
                Divide the warm sauce equally, drizzling it over 
                the tortilla chips on each plate.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each plate equally with the shredded Oaxaca cheese, 
                crumbled queso fresco, fresh cilantro leaves, sliced green onions, 
                diced avocado, and Mexican crema. Enjoy the ridiculously yummy 
                contrasting flavors, textures, and temperatures immediately!</li>
